	"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
	
	"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.
	
	"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
	
	"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
	
	"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
	
	"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
	
	"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
	
	2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
	
	   1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	   2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
	
	   3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
	
	   4.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
	
	You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
	
	5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

			    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

	 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
	                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
	 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
	 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
	
				    Preamble
	
	  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
	freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
	License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
	software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
	General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
	Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
	using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
	the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
	your programs, too.
	
	  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
	price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
	have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
	this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
	if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
	in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
	
	  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
	anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
	These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
	distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
	
	  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
	gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
	you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
	source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
	rights.
	
	  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
	(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
	distribute and/or modify the software.
	
	  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
	that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
	software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
	want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
	that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
	authors' reputations.
	
	  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
	patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
	program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
	program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
	patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
	
	  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
	modification follow.
	
			    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
	   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
	
	  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
	a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
	under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
	refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
	means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
	that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
	either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
	language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
	the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
	
	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
	covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
	running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
	is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
	Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
	Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
	
	  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
	source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
	conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
	copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
	notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
	and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
	along with the Program.
	
	You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
	you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
	
	  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
	of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
	distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
	above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
	
	    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
	    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
	
	    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
	    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
	    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
	    parties under the terms of this License.
	
	    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
	    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
	    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
	    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
	    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
	    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
	    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
	    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
	    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
	    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
	identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
	and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
	themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
	sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
	distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
	on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
	this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
	entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
	
	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
	your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
	exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
	collective works based on the Program.
	
	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
	with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
	a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
	the scope of this License.
	
	  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
	under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
	Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
	
	    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
	    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
	    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
	
	    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
	    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
	    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
	    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
	    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
	    customarily used for software interchange; or,
	
	    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
	    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
	    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
	    received the program in object code or executable form with such
	    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
	
	The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
	making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
	code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
	associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
	control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
	special exception, the source code distributed need not include
	anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
	form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
	operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
	itself accompanies the executable.
	
	If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
	access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
	access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
	distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
	compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

	  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
	except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
	otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
	void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
	However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
	this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
	parties remain in full compliance.
	
	  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
	signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
	distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
	prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
	modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
	Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
	all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
	the Program or works based on it.
	
	  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
	Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
	original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
	these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
	restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
	You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
	this License.
	
	  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
	infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
	conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
	excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
	distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
	may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
	license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
	all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
	the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
	refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
	
	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
	any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
	apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
	circumstances.
	
	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
	patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
	such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
	integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
	implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
	generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
	through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
	system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
	to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
	impose that choice.
	
	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
	be a consequence of the rest of this License.

	  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
	certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
	original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
	may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
	those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
	countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
	the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
	
	  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
	of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
	be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
	address new problems or concerns.
	
	Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
	specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
	later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
	either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
	Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
	this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
	Foundation.
	
	  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
	programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
	to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
	Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
	make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
	of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
	of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
	
				    NO WARRANTY
	
	  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
	FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
	OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
	PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
	OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
	TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
	PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
	REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
	
	  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
	WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
	REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
	INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
	OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
	TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
	YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
	PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
	POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
	
			     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
			     
		    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
	
	  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
	possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
	free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
	
	  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
	to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
	convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
	the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
	
	    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
	    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
	
	    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
	    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
	    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
	    (at your option) any later version.
	
	    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
	    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
	    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
	    GNU General Public License for more details.
	
	    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
	    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
	    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
	
	
	Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
	
	If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
	when it starts in an interactive mode:
	
	    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
	    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
	    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
	    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
	
	The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
	parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
	be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
	mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
	
	You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
	school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
	necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
	
	  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
	  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

	This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
	proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
	consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
	library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
	Public License instead of this License.

				   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
	                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
	
	Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
	Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
	of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
	
	
	  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
	the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
	License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
	
	  0. Additional Definitions. 
	
	  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
	General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
	General Public License.
	
	  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
	other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
	
	  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
	by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
	Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
	of using an interface provided by the Library.
	
	  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
	Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
	with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
	Version".
	
	  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
	Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
	for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
	based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
	
	  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
	object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
	and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
	Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
	
	  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
	
	  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
	without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
	
	  2. Conveying Modified Versions.
	
	  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
	facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
	that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
	facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
	version:
	
	   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
	   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
	   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
	   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
	
	   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
	   this License applicable to that copy.
	
	  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
	
	  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
	a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
	code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
	material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
	layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
	(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
	
	   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
	   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
	   covered by this License.
	
	   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
	   document.
	
	  4. Combined Works.
	
	  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
	taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
	portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
	engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
	the following:
	
	   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
	   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
	   covered by this License.
	
	   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
	   document.
	
	   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
	   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
	   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
	   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
	
	   d) Do one of the following:
	
	       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
	       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
	       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
	       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
	       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
	       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
	       Corresponding Source.
	
	       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
	       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
	       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
	       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
	       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
	       Version. 
	
	   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
	   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
	   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
	   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
	   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
	   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
	   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
	   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
	   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
	   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
	   for conveying Corresponding Source.)
	
	  5. Combined Libraries.
	
	  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
	Library side by side in a single library together with other library
	facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
	License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
	choice, if you do both of the following:
	
	   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
	   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
	   conveyed under the terms of this License.
	
	   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
	   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
	   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
	
	  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
	
	  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
	of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
	versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
	differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
	
	  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
	Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
	of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
	applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
	conditions either of that published version or of any later version
	published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
	received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
	General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
	General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
	
	  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
	whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
	apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
	permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
	Library.

	THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
	COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
	COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
	AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
	
	BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
	TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
	RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS
	AND CONDITIONS.
	
	*1. Definitions*
	
	   1. *"Collective Work"* means a work, such as a periodical issue,
	      anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
	      unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
	      constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
	      assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
	      Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
	      defined below) for the purposes of this License.
	   2. *"Derivative Work"* means a work based upon the Work or upon the
	      Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
	      arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
	      version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
	      condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
	      transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
	      Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
	      purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
	      Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the
	      synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
	      ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose
	      of this License.
	   3. *"Licensor"* means the individual or entity that offers the Work
	      under the terms of this License.
	   4. *"Original Author"* means the individual or entity who created the
	      Work.
	   5. *"Work"* means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under
	      the terms of this License.
	   6. *"You"* means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
	      License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
	      with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
	      from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
	      previous violation.
	
	*2. Fair Use Rights.* Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
	limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
	limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
	copyright law or other applicable laws.
	
	*3. License Grant.* Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
	Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
	perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
	exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
	
	   1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
	      Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
	      Collective Works;
	   2. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
	   3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
	      publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
	      transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
	   4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
	      publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
	      transmission Derivative Works.
	   5.
	
	      For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
	
	         1. *Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses*. Licensor
	            waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually
	            or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI,
	            SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public
	            digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
	         2. *Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties*. Licensor waives
	            the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via
	            a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
	            Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the
	            Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
	            compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
	            Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
	   6. *Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties*. For the avoidance of
	      doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
	      exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
	      performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
	      public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
	      the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
	      Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
	
	The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
	known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
	such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
	in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor
	are hereby reserved.
	
	*4. Restrictions.*The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
	made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
	
	   1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
	      publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
	      License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
	      Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
	      Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
	      publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
	      on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
	      the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
	      not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
	      refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may
	      not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
	      digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
	      control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
	      the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work
	      as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
	      the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject
	      to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work,
	      upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
	      remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause
	      4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
	      from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
	      the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as
	      requested.
	   2. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
	      digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective
	      Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
	      provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
	      the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
	      supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor
	      designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute,
	      publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's
	      copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means,
	      the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if
	      supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform
	      Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
	      associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
	      copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the
	      case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the
	      Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work
	      by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
	      Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any
	      reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
	      Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will
	      appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in
	      a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
	      credit.
	
	*5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer*
	
	UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
	OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
	KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
	INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
	FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
	LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
	WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
	EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
	
	*6. Limitation on Liability.* EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
	APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL
	THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
	DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
	LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
	
	*7. Termination*
	
	   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
	      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
	      Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
	      Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not
	      have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
	      entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections
	      1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
	   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
	      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
	      the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right
	      to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
	      distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
	      election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
	      license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
	      terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
	      force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
	
	*8. Miscellaneous*
	
	   1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or
	      a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license
	      to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license

			    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
			       Version 2, June 1991
	
	 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
	 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
	 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
	 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
	
				    Preamble
	
	  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
	freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
	License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
	software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
	General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
	Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
	using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
	the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
	your programs, too.
	
	  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
	price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
	have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
	this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
	if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
	in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
	
	  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
	anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
	These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
	distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
	
	  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
	gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
	you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
	source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
	rights.
	
	  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
	(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
	distribute and/or modify the software.
	
	  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
	that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
	software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
	want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
	that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
	authors' reputations.
	
	  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
	patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
	program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
	program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
	patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
	
	  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
	modification follow.
	
			    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
	   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
	
	  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
	a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
	under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
	refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
	means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
	that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
	either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
	language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
	the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
	
	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
	covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
	running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
	is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
	Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
	Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
	
	  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
	source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
	conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
	copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
	notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
	and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
	along with the Program.
	
	You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
	you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
	
	  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
	of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
	distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
	above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
	
	    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
	    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
	
	    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
	    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
	    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
	    parties under the terms of this License.
	
	    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
	    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
	    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
	    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
	    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
	    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
	    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
	    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
	    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
	    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
	
	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
	identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
	and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
	themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
	sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
	distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
	on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
	this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
	entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
	
	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
	your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
	exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
	collective works based on the Program.
	
	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
	with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
	a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
	the scope of this License.
	
	  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
	under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
	Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
	
	    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
	    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
	    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
	
	    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
	    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
	    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
	    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
	    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
	    customarily used for software interchange; or,
	
	    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
	    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
	    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
	    received the program in object code or executable form with such
	    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
	
	The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
	making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
	code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
	associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
	control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
	special exception, the source code distributed need not include
	anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
	form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
	operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
	itself accompanies the executable.
	
	If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
	access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
	access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
	distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
	compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
	
	  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
	except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
	otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
	void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
	However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
	this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
	parties remain in full compliance.
	
	  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
	signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
	distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
	prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
	modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
	Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
	all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
	the Program or works based on it.
	
	  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
	Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
	original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
	these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
	restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
	You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
	this License.
	
	  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
	infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
	conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
	excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
	distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
	may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
	license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
	all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
	the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
	refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
	
	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
	any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
	apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
	circumstances.
	
	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
	patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
	such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
	integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
	implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
	generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
	through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
	system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
	to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
	impose that choice.
	
	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
	be a consequence of the rest of this License.
	
	  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
	certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
	original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
	may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
	those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
	countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
	the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
	
	  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
	of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
	be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
	address new problems or concerns.
	
	Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
	specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
	later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
	either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
	Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
	this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
	Foundation.
	
	  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
	programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
	to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
	Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
	make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
	of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
	of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
	
				    NO WARRANTY
	
	  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
	FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
	OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
	PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
	OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
	TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
	PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
	REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
	
	  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
	WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
	REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
	INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
	OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
	TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
	YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
	PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
	POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
	
			     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
	
		    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
	
	  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
	possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
	free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
	
	  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
	to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
	convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
	the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
	
	    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
	    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
	
	    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
	    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
	    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
	    (at your option) any later version.
	
	    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
	    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
	    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
	    GNU General Public License for more details.
	
	    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
	    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
	    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
	
	Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
	
	If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
	when it starts in an interactive mode:
	
	    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
	    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
	    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
	    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
	
	The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
	parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
	be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
	mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
	
	You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
	school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
	necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
	
	  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
	  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
	
	  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
	  Ty Coon, President of Vice
	
	This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
	proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
	consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
	library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
	Public License instead of this License.

	    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
	    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
	    parties under the terms of this License.
	
	    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
	    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
	    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
	    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
	    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
	    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
	    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
	    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
	    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
	    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
	
	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
	identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
	and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
	themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
	sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
	distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
	on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
	this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
	entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
	
	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
	your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
	exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
	collective works based on the Program.
	
	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
	with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
	a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
	the scope of this License.
	
	  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
	under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
	Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
	
	    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
	    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
	    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
	
	    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
	    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
	    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
	    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
	    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
	    customarily used for software interchange; or,
	
	    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
	    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
	    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
	    received the program in object code or executable form with such
	    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
	
	The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
	making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
	code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
	associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
	control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
	special exception, the source code distributed need not include
	anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
	form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
	operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
	itself accompanies the executable.
	
	If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
	access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
	access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
	distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
	compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
	
	  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
	except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
	otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
	void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
	However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
	this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
	parties remain in full compliance.
	
	  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
	signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
	distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
	prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
	modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
	Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
	all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
	the Program or works based on it.
	
	  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
	Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
	original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
	these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
	restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
	You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
	this License.
	
	  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
	infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
	conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
	excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
	distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
	may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
	license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
	all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
	the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
	refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
	
	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
	any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
	apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
	circumstances.
	
	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
	patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
	such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
	integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
	implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
	generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
	through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
	system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
	to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
	impose that choice.
	
	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
	be a consequence of the rest of this License.
	
	  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
	certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
	original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
	may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
	those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
	countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
	the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
	
	  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
	of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
	be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
	address new problems or concerns.
	
	Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
	specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
	later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
	either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
	Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
	this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
	Foundation.
	
	  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
	programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
	to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
	Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
	make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
	of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
	of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
	
	          NO WARRANTY
	
	  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
	FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
	OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
	PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
	OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
	TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
	PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
	REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
	
	  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
	WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
	REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
	INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
	OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
	TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
	YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
	PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
	POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
